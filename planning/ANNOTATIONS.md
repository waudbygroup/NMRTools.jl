# Pulse program annotation schema

## Syntax – programmatic arrays

- parameter: {type, start, step}
- parameter: {type, start, end}
- type = linear | logarithmic
- ‘parameter’ must occur in ‘dimensions’ to determine the array length

### Converting from vclists to durations

- duration: {counter: array, scale: X}
  durations = X * array

Channel references (`f1`…`f8`) resolve against the spectrometer channel model
(`channels(spec, ...)`), which holds the nucleus, base frequency, and carrier for every
channel — not just the detected ones. As a result, an `offset` frequency list converts to
absolute ppm even when its channel's nucleus is never detected (e.g. a 13C CEST profile
read out on a 1H axis): if no detected axis matches the channel, the channel's own bf/sfo
are used as the reference.
