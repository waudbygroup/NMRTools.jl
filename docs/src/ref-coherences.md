# Coherences and isotope data

NMRTools defines commonly used [nuclei](@ref Nuclei) and provides a framework for identifying single- and multiple-quantum [coherences](@ref Coherences) associated with them. [Reference data](@ref "Reference data") on their gyromagnetic ratios, and spin quantum numbers, is also defined and accessible through simple functions.
