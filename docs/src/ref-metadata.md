# Metadata

[`NMRData`](@ref) objects can store various metadata associated with the spectrum and each of the dimensions.

Metadata are stored as dictionaries using symbols as keys (e.g. `:ns`). They can be accessed using the `metadata` function, or directly from an `NMRData` object using a dictionary-style lookup. Metadata associated with axes are accessed by providing an additional reference, either as a dimension number or type (e.g. `F1Dim`, `F2Dim` etc.).

```julia
metadata(nmrdata, key) # spectrum metadata
nmrdata[key]

metadata(nmrdata, dimension, key) # axis metadata
nmrdata[dimension, key]
```

```@docs; canonical=false
metadata
```

## Labels

```@docs; canonical=false
label
label!
units
```

## Acquisition data

When spectra are loaded, the contents of the `acqus` file  are parsed (as are the `acqu2s` files etc. too, if present). These can be accessed with `:acqus` and `:acqu2s` keys, etc. For convenience though, the additional function [`acqus`](@ref) is provided to access acquisiton data directly.

```@docs; canonical=false
acqus
```

## Auxilliary files

`acqus` can also be used to access the contents of auxilliary files (and if not present, `nothing` will be returned). Note that NMRTools will perform automatic unit conversion as follows:
- `:vclist`: variable loopcounter
- `:vdlist`: variable delays, in seconds
- `:valist`: variable amplitude, in dB (converted from Watts if necessary)
- `:vplist`: variable pulse lengths, in seconds
- `:fq1list` up to `:fq8list`: frequency lists â€“ see [Frequency lists](@ref) for more information.

## Frequency lists

Frequency lists can be specified on the spectrometer in a number of ways - in Hz, in ppm, and relative to the spectrometer frequency or the base frequency (0 ppm). Frequency lists are therefore stored in NMRTools as `FQList` structures which encode this additional information.

```@docs; canonical=false
FQList
```

Raw numerical data can be accessed using the `data()` function, but it is recommended to use `getppm` and `getoffset` functions to access frequency data safely.

```@docs; canonical=false
FQList
getppm
getoffset
```
