# Metadata

[`NMRData`](@ref) objects contain comprehensive metadata on processing and acquisition parameters that are populated automatically upon loading a spectrum. Entries are divided into *spectrum* metadata - associated with the experiment in general - and *axis* metadata, that are associated with a particular dimension of the data.


## Accessing spectrum metadata

Metadata entries are labelled by symbols such as `:ns` or `:pulseprogram`. See below for a list of all available symbols. Entries can be accessed using the `metadata` function, or directly as a dictionary-style lookup

```@repl 1
using NMRTools; # hide
spec = exampledata("2D_HN"); # hide
metadata(spec, :ns)
spec[:ns]
metadata(spec, :title)
spec[:title]
```

Help on metadata symbols is available

```@repl 1
metadatahelp(:td)
```


## Accessing axis metadata

Axis metadata can be accessed by providing an addition axis label, i.e. `F1Dim`, `F2Dim`.

```@repl 1
metadata(spec, F1Dim, :label)
spec[F1Dim, :label]
spec[1, :label]
metadata(spec, F2Dim, :label)
spec[F2Dim, :label]
spec[2, :label]
```


## Accessing acquisition parameters

Spectrometer acquisition parameters are automatically parsed from the `acqus` file when data are loaded. This is stored as a dictionary in the `:acqus` entry of the spectrum metadata, but can more conveniently be accessed through the convenience function `acqus(spec, :parametername)`. Note that parameter names are not case sensitive.

```@repl 1
acqus(spec, :bf1)
acqus(spec, :te)
```

Arrayed parameters such as pulse lengths can be accessed as lists or by supplying an additional index parameter

```@repl 1
acqus(spec, :p)
acqus(spec, :p, 1)
acqus(spec, :cnst, 4)
```

!!! note
    Lists of parameters are returned as zero-based arrays (in contrast to typical Julia arrays, which are unit-based) to match Bruker naming conventions


## Auxiliary files

If present, files such as `vclist` and `vdlist` are imported and can be accessed through the `acqus` function

```@repl 1
pseudo3dspec = exampledata("pseudo3D_HN_R2"); # hide
acqus(pseudo3dspec, :vclist)
```

## Window functions

Window functions are represented by subtypes of the abstract type `WindowFunction`, each of which contain appropriate parameters to specify the particular function applied. In addition, the acquisition time ``t_{max}`` is also stored (calculated at the point of application, i.e. after linear prediction but before zero filling).

Available window functions:
* `NullWindow(tmax)`: no window function applied
* `UnknownWindow(tmax)`: unrecognised window function
* `ExponentialWindow(lb, tmax)`: line broadening specified in Hz
* `SineWindow(offset, endpoint, power, tmax)`: a supertype encompassing some special cases
  - `CosWindow(tmax)`: apodization by a pure half-cosine window
  - `CosÂ²Window(tmax)`: apodization by a pure half-cosine-squared window
  - `GeneralSineWindow(offset, endpoint, power, tmax)`: other general cases
* `GaussWindow(expHz, gaussHz, center, tmax)`: a supertype encompassing some special cases
  - `LorentzToGaussWindow(expHz, gaussHz, tmax)`
  - `GeneralGaussWindow(expHz, gaussHz, center, tmax)`: other general cases
