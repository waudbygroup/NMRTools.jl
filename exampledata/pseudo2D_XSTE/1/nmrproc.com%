# Basic 2D Phase-Sensitive Processing:
#   Cosine-Bells are used in both dimensions.
#   Use of "ZF -auto" doubles size, then rounds to power of 2.
#   Use of "FT -auto" chooses correct Transform mode.
#   Imaginaries are deleted with "-di" in each dimension.
#   Phase corrections should be inserted by hand.
